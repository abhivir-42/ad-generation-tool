## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Frontend Development

### **Step 1: Setup Next.js and TailwindCSS**

- Initialize a Next.js project.
- Install and configure TailwindCSS.

### **Step 2: Implement Chat UI**

- Develop a chat interface for user input.
- Integrate WebSockets or polling for real-time updates.

### **Step 3: Script Display and Editing**

- Create a UI component to display the generated script.
- Implement inline editing features.
- Add buttons for refinement requests.

### **Step 4: API Integration**

- Connect frontend with FastAPI endpoints.
- Ensure data flow between chat input, script updates, and AI responses.

### **Step 5: Styling and Enhancements**

- Use TailwindCSS for responsive UI design.
- Add animations and transitions for better UX.

### 3.2 Backend Development

### **Step 6: Setup FastAPI**

- Initialize a FastAPI project.
- Setup basic API endpoints.

### **Step 7: Implement AI Agents with CrewAI**

- Define agent roles and behaviors.
- Implement task orchestration logic.

### **Step 8: Develop API Endpoints**

- `/generate-script`: Generates initial ad script.
- `/refine-script`: Enhances specific parts of the script.
- `/art-direction`: Suggests visual elements.

### **Optional Step 9: Optimize Performance (leave for later unless it is easy to implement)**

- Implement caching for AI responses.
- Optimize request handling.

---

### 3.3 Deployment Strategy

### **Step 10: Deploy Frontend (explain to me how to do this)**

- Deploy to Vercel with automatic CI/CD.
- Configure environment variables.

### **Step 11: Deploy Backend (explain to me how to do this step)**

- Deploy to Vercel.
- Monitor and log API requests.

---

### 4. Next Steps (Leave this for later. No need to implement these right now)

1. Develop test cases for unit and integration testing.
2. Implement authentication and user session management (if required).
3. Conduct usability testing and refine UI/UX.
4. Launch beta testing and iterate based on user feedback.

This document provides a structured roadmap for building the AI-Powered Ad Script Generator efficiently.
